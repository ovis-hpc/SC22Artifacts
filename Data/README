Experimental data artifacts for runs in Section V.

* ldms_daily_runtimes.csv: This is a list of elaspsed runtimes of the successful daily runs of EMPIRE in-the-wild (Section V-B). Job numbering is arbitrary.

* ldms_runtimes_jobid_1-4.csv: This is a list of elaspsed runtimes of the 4 (longer walltime) runs in Section V-C. Numbering is the same as Table I.
        
The following detailed data files are for the runs in Section V-C, one of each type per job. Numbering is the same as Table I.
        
* ldms_kokkos_artifacts_jobid_#.csv: This file contains the anonymized data for the kernel functions collected by LDMS from Kokkos. The following information was collected for each kernel function call collected: timestamp,node_name, job_id, rank, name, type, current_kernel_count, total_kernel_count, level, current_kernel_time, and total_kernel_time.

* ldms_procstat_artifacts_jobid_#.csv: This file contains the anaonymized data for the procstat data collected by LDMS for the specific application and their runs.
